### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mircha Emanuel `ryuujin` D'Angelo, Full Stack Developer on Netsons/Athomos (https://www.netsons.com): https://github.com/ryuujinos

Iâ€™m a Full-stack developer and Software Architect from Pescara, Italia. I have more than 17 years of experience designing and developing a wide variety of business applications.

In my projects I pay particular attention to security, latest technologies and people. I adopt Agile Methodologies and Test-Driven Development to ensure good quality and painless upgrade of the product.

My experience allows me to afford almost every project with a little effort in studying the specific details and technology.
